# Lawyer Billings Smart Contract

This was done as part of SMU Blockchain's Developer Wing programme.

This smart contract allows transparency on billable hours between lawyers and their clients. The smart contract records the tasks done by lawyers and allows the client to review them.

Here are the use cases for now:
1. Register a Lawyer
2. Register a Client
3. Create a Task
4. Look up a Lawyer
5. Look up a Client
6. Calculate total billable hours done by a Lawyer for a specific Client

Future uses cases to be implemented:
1. Look up all the tasks done by a Lawyer for a specific Client
2. Client to approve tasks
